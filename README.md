# PasswordGenerator

This project required me to create a Javascript password generator 8 - 128 characters long using upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.

If the password length does not meet the criteria, the generator will not move to the next step. 

If it does meet the criterea, the generator will ask which 4 attributes the password should include. 

After the 4 attributes have been selected a random password is created using the correlating characters and length of password selected.
